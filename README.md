# Single cell and multi-omics analyses of lymphomagenesis

This repository contains scripts for analyzing omics data of

- 10X Single-Cell RNA-Seq
- bulk RNA-Seq
- acetylproteomics
- metabolomics

in a project studying lymphoma evolution. The project aims to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphomagenesis and identify new targets for therapy.
